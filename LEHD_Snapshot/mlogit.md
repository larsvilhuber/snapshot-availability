## Missing Completely at Random
The decision to participate ($M$) is (most likely) not correlated with any observable characteristic ($Y$) of the non-participating states. Expressed as

> $p(M | Y, \theta, \psi) = p(M|\psi)$

where $\theta$ are parameters associated with the data generating process, and $\psi$ are parameters associated with the decision to participate in Option **A**. We test this using a multinomial logit of the Options on the chosen variable:
